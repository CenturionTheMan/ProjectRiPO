# Road Traffic Object Detection

This repository contains code for road traffic object detection using deep learning models such as YOLO. It aims to detect
various objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, stop and warning signs.

## Introduction

Road traffic object detection is a crucial task in various applications such as autonomous driving, traffic
monitoring, and surveillance. This project utilizes learning techniques to accurately detect and classify
objects in road traffic scenes.

## Features

- Utilizes deep learning models for object detection
- Project implements custom written interface class for custom object detection using either clean YOLO or any
  model from Roboflow. In basic configuration it  
  supports detection of vehicles, pedestrians, stop and warnings traffic signs
